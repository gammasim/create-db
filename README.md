# create-db
This repository is temporary and is for internal use only.

The main purpose of this code is to create the MongoDB from the YAML files we used to use. Since this should be done only once there is no need to use this script again. Therefore, no real documentation is provided with this script. However, it is placed here for future reference. If you need to use it, please contact the author.

The minimum requirement to use this is to have a working setup of gammasim-tools (with the python path pointing to it) and the two configuration files necessary also for gammasim-tools (config.yml and dbDetails.yml). Notice that the latter is confidential. Even more so in this case, since only specific users are allowed to create DBs.
The last requirement are the yaml files in https://gitlab.cta-observatory.org/cta-consortium/aswg/simulations/simulation-model/simulation-model-description/-/tree/master/configReports.
