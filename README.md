# create-db
This repository is temporary and is for internal use only.

The main purpose of this code is to create the MongoDB from the YAML files we used to use. Since this should be done only once there is no need to use this script again. Therefore, no real documentation is provided with this script. However, it is placed here for future reference. If you need to use it, please contact the authors.
